#1. Randomly select an element from a list

#2. Generate a random number in 0/1
import random
random uniform = random.(0, 1)
#3. Use random in 0/1 to mask 50% of the words in a string

#4. Use random in 0/1 to mask 70% of the words in a string

#5. Turn a string into capital/lowercase letters

#6. Get an input from the user using the default input() method

#7. Check if an element is in a list/dictionary using the 'in' statement

#8. Remove an element from a list/dictionary

#9. Load in memory the content of a text file

#10. The use of enumerate() in a for loop

#11. Define a function that returns more than one element (introduce the idea of "tuple")

# Exercise
# - take a random word as string e.g. "umbrella"
# - Iterate over all the characters in the string with a for-loop (with enumerate)
# - Use the character as key of a dictionary
# - For each key add a list as value that contains the positions/index
#     of that character in the string.
#
# e.g. for the word "umbrella" the dictionary should be: 
# {'u': [0], 'm': [1], 'b': [2], 'r': [3], 'e': [4], 'l': [5, 6], 'a': [7]}
