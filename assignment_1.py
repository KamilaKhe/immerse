# where 3 is the maximum number of attempts for guessing the word (score==0 the user lost)

#2. Pick a random word from all the available words.

#4. Use the function get_masked_word() that I provided for you above.
# This function returns the masked word, and a dictionary.
# The dictionary contains the masked letters as keys,
# and a list of their positions as values.
# e.g. if you call the function in this way: get_masked_word("UNICORN")
# the result could be: ('U-IC---', {'N': [1, 6], 'O': [4], 'R': [5]})

# type a letter in the terminal, you can use the default method input()
print (masked_word)

#6. You need to check if the user provided more than one letter.
# If this is the case, take just the first character and discard the rest.

#7. Turn the character provided by the user into a capital letter

#8. Check if the letter provided by the user is a good one or a bad one.
# Recall: in step-4 you used the function get_masked_word() to get a dictionary of masked letters.
# If the letter is in the dictionary then it's a GOOD one (show this letter in masked_word)
# If the letter is NOT in the dictionary it's a BAD one (decrease the score)

#9. Print the current user score, the masked word, and the list of letters already tried.
